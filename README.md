# hello-world

Hello world, full of fortune and opportunity! 

One day I will be the Coding King, on my master branch and everything!
Until then I will keep using branches religiously in case I need to reload a certain checkpoint or two or three or four or five...

I'm sure you get the picture.

If not please see below:

If expressed in Ruby it would be the following:

project_finished = false
puts project_finished ? "Time to merge!" : "We most likely need at least 1 more branch!"

Fin.
